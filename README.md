# Work Day Scheduler 

## Overview 
This repository contians code for an online Work-Day Scheduler. The interface is broken down into hour long sessions which start at 9am and ending at 5pm to resemble the typical work day. The hour-block sections are also dynamically color coded and will change according to the currrent time in the day. If we have moved past a time-block then the row will turn gray. If the time-block is in the future the row will be green. The time-block for that represents the current time will be in red. 

## Usage 
The schedualr is simple to use and only requires the user to type into the apporopriate time-block and then click the "save" icon on the right side of of each row. The User will need to click the save icon for each row they wish to schedule. After saving, the user should notice a notification pop up at the top of the scheduler that says "Appointment Added to Local Storage".

Below are screenshots of the working application. 

*note* All rows are green in the demo beacause it conducted after midnight. The date automatically changes to the following day and the scheduler color coding will reset.
